        <p>
          Asset Recovery Firm specializes in recovering overages funds of
          residential properties that have fallen into foreclosure. We help
          prior owners and occupiers recover funds called overages, which are
          the excess funds collected when a foreclosed property is sold for more
          than what is owed. State and county laws provide a specified time
          window to recover these funds, and we are experts in navigating this
          process.
